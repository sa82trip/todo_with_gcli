* TODO App

This is a simple Todo application built with React. It allows users to add, delete, and view todo items. The application manages its state in memory without a separate database.

** How to Run

    #+begin_src bash
    npm install
    #+end_src

2.  **Start the Development Server**:
    #+begin_src bash

    #+end_src

    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is in use).
